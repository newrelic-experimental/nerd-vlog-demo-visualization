# Nerd Log Demo Visualization

> This is an example Nerdpack with a Visualization that was built during the NerdLog session the last week of February 2021.

## Installation

> To get started, you'll need the [New Relic One CLI](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/nr1-cli). Follow the setup instructions there and then run the following: 

  1. This repo contains a `.nvmrc`, if you use nvm locally, run `nvm use` or set your node version to 10 using your preffered node version manager.
  1. Run `nr1 nerdpack:uuid -g` to generate a UUID associated with your selected profile.
  
  > _Note: you can see what your current default profile is & update the default by running `nr1 profiles:default`._

  1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
  1. Run `nr1 nerdpack:serve` 
  1. Click the link in the terminal output to load the locally running nerdpack in New Relic or add `nerdpacks=local` to the URL query string in your New Relic One view.

## Getting Started
> You can add more Visualizations and other Nerdpack related code by running `nr1 create` if you want to extend this Nerdpack further, or try making adjustments to the current Visualization! For more documentation, visit https://developer.newrelic.com.
